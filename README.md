# sijia-coding-test-CB
Instruction: Your experience is interesting to us. The next step is to complete this test. We send it to very few candidates, only about 3% as we don't want to waste your time or ours reviewing the code of someone we're not interested in. See https://constructionbevy.com/#/about those are the professionals you'd be working with and each engineer except our co-founding CTO started with a Full Stack, Front End or Back End coding test. Let me know if you intend to complete it and when. If we like your code, the next step is to schedule a video call for a technical screen with our a member of our engineering staff. Thank you.

Using the Vue.js framework, create a blog. There should be a home page where you can access all of the blog posts as well as individual pages for each blog post. The design and layout are up to you. For content, feel free to use Lorem Ipsum for the text and any pictures you choose from the web. Add any features that you feel would contribute to the userâ€™s experience with the blog (sorting, filtering, categories, recently viewed, etc.). This is where you can best differentiate yourself. If needed, you may create a simple API or you can hardcode where needed - be sure to use coding best practices otherwise.

Create a public GitHub repository and share the link with us once you are complete. Include any necessary information for running the project locally in the README.

Final Notes
This is an open ended project meant for us to get a sense of how you write code and solve problems.
We will be reviewing your code and comparing it with our current staff's effort when they were a candidate, along with candidates we are actively considering.
